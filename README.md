# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Project
Hand gesture recognition project for EECS 4422 Computer Vision

This project contain all the code involved with the Fast Hand Gesture Recognition algorithm that is described in the paper in this folder.
The image and video folder contain some samples that were used in testing the final outcome. 
The Failed folder contains all the images that have some sort of interesting outcome compared to what the human eye sees.
The Completed folder contains all the output masks after applying the algorithm.

To run this simply open the python code in any complier/text-editor that runs python (I used Atom to run all of this) and run the code.
Make sure that the image/videos that you are trying to use are in the folder images/videos
